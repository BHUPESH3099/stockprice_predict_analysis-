In this project, I have utilized several Python packages:

Pandas: Used for managing and structuring data. Pandas provides the DataFrame data structure, which facilitates data manipulation and analysis.

yfinance: This Python package allows fetching historical stock market data, enabling various analyses based on stock market trends and patterns.

scikit-learn (sklearn): Employed for performing linear regression and analyzing data. Scikit-learn offers a wide range of machine learning algorithms, including regression models, for predictive modeling and analysis tasks.

Plotly Express: Chosen for plotting interactive visualizations. Plotly Express provides a high-level interface for creating various types of plots, including scatter plots, line plots, and bar charts. Its interactive capabilities enhance data exploration and presentation.
